# ArgosStockChecker
Argos stock checker for Windows Phone 8.0 / 8.1

This handy little app was published on the Windows Phone store for some time.
It will find Argos stores local to you via geo-location, and then let you search for goodies to buy.
You'll see which stores locally have stock, as well as being able to view product details, images, and reviews.

## Disclaimer

On your own with this one! Not even sure it still works! Argos have a habit of changing things with their (non-public) API.
